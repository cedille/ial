{- The following code gives the basic idea of division by repeated
   subtraction.  We have to ask Agda not to check termination of this
   function, because it is not structurally terminating.  The versions
   in nat-division.agda and nat-division-wf.agda correct this problem,
   and can be judged by Agda to be terminating. -}

{- In some cases you may want to block certain terms from being
  evaluated by Agda at compile time.  I found I needed to do this
  when generating large terms intended for evaluation at run-time only.
  You can use the runtime-only function for this.  If its first
  argument is tt, then we will use a postulate runtime-identity
  to block Agda's compile-time evaluation.  Otherwise, we will
  not block compile-time evaluation. -}
